Kinda like a soft shell taco with a little more texture to the taco bit. Good tho. It also came with a hard shell taco you could swap out for a soft shell (big fan) and then the cinnamon twists which i also think are only good in a box- but if you swapped the cinnamon twists for the tortilla chips and dip, you could get some trashy chips and some DELICIOUS cheese sauce, ideal for making the soft shell or chalupa supreme better. Yeah, chalupa cravings box was where it was at. I don't know how many times I ate that in texas but it was not enough and the box was taken from me too soon.
