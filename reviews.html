        The beefy 5: (7/10)(a classic as always)<br>
The beefy 5 was fine tho. Not too hot. Well done beefy 5. No sour cream clumps. Delicious.<br><br>
The fiesta potatoes:(8/10) over priced outside the box, perfect addition here tho. Well seasoned. A bit of sauce really rounded out the sour cream/cheese/ crunchy potato mix.<br><br>
Baja blast: 10/10 no question MVP carried the whole t bizzy experience. would commit war crimes for it. <br><br>
The crunchwrap supreme: (6/10) would be a 4/10 if it wasn’t for the stellar box value. The lechuga is a bit of a turn off- not sure if I like it. Also the strange shape led to a donald trump 5D chess level of strategy being needed to avoid getting cheese sauce on my face. Also, the hard, now soft tortilla in the crunchwrap wasn’t my favorite part. It’s easy to focus on the negative but I did give it a 6/10 because i could look past those flaws and enjoy the taco bell experience with this classic item. It’s been 2+ years since I last had one and probably won’t get it again soon.
