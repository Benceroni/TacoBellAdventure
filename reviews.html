        (all included in the my cravings box)(4 Oct 2022)<br><br>
        The beefy 5: (7/10)(a classic as always)<br>
The beefy 5 was fine tho. Not too hot. Well done beefy 5. No sour cream clumps. Delicious.<br><br>
The fiesta potatoes:(8/10) over priced outside the box, perfect addition here tho. Well seasoned. A bit of sauce really rounded out the sour cream/cheese/ crunchy potato mix.<br><br>
Baja blast: 10/10 no question MVP carried the whole t bizzy experience. would commit war crimes for it. <br><br>
The crunchwrap supreme: (6/10) would be a 4/10 if it wasn’t for the stellar box value. The lechuga is a bit of a turn off- not sure if I like it. Also the strange shape led to a donald trump 5D chess level of strategy being needed to avoid getting cheese sauce on my face. Also, the hard, now soft tortilla in the crunchwrap wasn’t my favorite part. It’s easy to focus on the negative but I did give it a 6/10 because i could look past those flaws and enjoy the taco bell experience with this classic item. It’s been 2+ years since I last had one and probably won’t get it again soon.<br><br>

Soft taco supreme: (5/10) Good but pricy for a slightly better soft taco. Also falls apart unlike a burrito.<br><br>
Beefy melt burrito : (8/10) Decent value for a standalone item. Didn’t fall apart or burst from the pressure of ingredients working their way down the burrito as I ate it. Tasted good. Went well with t bizzy sauce.<br><br>
Baja blast: (10/10) Top notch value (only a dollar for a medium between 2-5pm)(would be an outstanding value even if it was 10x that) amazing taste, the nectar of the gods. Rumored to be the liquid version of the mana from heaven provided the the wandering israelites in the wilderness.<br><br>

Hit up the t bizzy in casual taco bell attire. Currently enjoying the baha blast.<br>
This is the kind of fine dining experience I've been craving.<br>
The Doritos locos tacos cardboard- holding it perfectly for every bite but the last.<br>
The sauce packets- and only the mild sauce packets- feeling like they had been covered in Baja blast and left to dry.<br>
The lobby- constantly having at least 1 employee on break. <br>
The hanging lights- placed with years of planning and perfect calculation for me to hit it with my head not once, but thrice.<br>
My stomach- hurting as I took the last few bites of my last burrito.<br>
My phone- dryer than the Mojave.<br><br>

Yes. This is the perfect taco bell experience.<br><br>

Edit: hit my head a 4th time composing [this review].
