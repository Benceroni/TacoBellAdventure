            <h3>Bencer’s review of le potatoes on 1 november 2022</h3>
            <p><em>Prompted by the tauntings of a friend: “So nothing on the potatoes ???"</em></p>
                <p>I’m currently waiting for super glue to cure. I should be doing other things but here I am.</p>
                <p>Upon opening my potatoes, I doused them with two sauces. Re-lidded and shook(😳)</p>
<p>The sauce coverage wasn’t sufficient but I decided to eat them anyway. Unplasticing the fork so graciously provided me by the employees of the bell, I realized the sauce coverage wasn’t even good enough for a first bite, and subsequently rained down two more taco bell mild sauce packets. </p>
<p>I started eating and the first few bites were good. Like that first bite of junk food. Usually better than the rest- even if it isn’t really that good. As i ate, I thought about how these weren’t anything special and that a review would probably be like a 6/10- and I like the fiesta potatoes and don’t want to give them a mediocre score, so i’d come up with some reason to not give them a score to protect my baby. </p>
<p>Probably ⅔ of the way through I unwrapped my beefy 6 burrito and started eating it. It then clicked that I still had fiesta potatoes left and felt kinda bad that I had abandoned them. I don’t think i’ve ever done that before.
    I finished them up and was trying to decide if the last few bites were giving me soggy potato feels or if they were good still.
    </p>
<p>I finished the potatoes, and started using it as a dead sauce packet graveyard. I put 3 or 4 sauce packets into the fiesta potatoes container then covered them and left the rest of my sauce packets in the wrapping of the beefy 6 burrito</p>
<p>The fiesta potatoes were feeling camera shy today so I have no photos.
