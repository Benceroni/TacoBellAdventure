          <p>
            Ok pre game check. I thought i might hit the bell after FHE. Was
            already wearing nice pants so I brought my suit jacket. Perhaps gray
            on gray is a fashon crime. So what if i’m a criminal.
          </p>

          <p>
            I pull up to t bizzy. They’re the fastest burrito makers in the
            west. (It took like 2 minutes from ordering) so i held off from
            ordering until being greeted by the overwhelming experience of the
            bell’s interior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entering the t bell, i saw all the regular sights, sounds and
            wonders. (Worker on break, soda drips all over the fountain machine,
            general mexican smell) but also took in the beauty of a taco bell
            ready for halloween. They basically have decorations everywhere and
            it really improves on the true mexican and day of the dead feel i’ve
            come to expect.

            <h4>
              At the formal request (begging) and recommendation of multiple
              friends, I have given the grilled cheese burrito another chance.
              This is the third time: (Deferred judgment/10)
            </h4>
            <p>
              Honestly don’t think i can give the grilled cheese burrito a fair
              shake on this visit, despite coming exclusively to review it (and
              enjoy 4 gallons of baja blast). Just not feeling fantastic tonight
              so i’ll hold off on the official bell review™ score. Despite being
              made lightning fast and cracking into the burrito almost
              immediately, if wasn’t “beefy 5 straight off the line” hot which I
              appreciate. Last time i said getting the large baja blast was the
              flex but no. It’s buying standalone items off the menu instead of
              getting them in a box. The burrito was decent. I think the worst
              part is the grease. I don’t think burritos from t bizzy should
              glisten(see below). They already shine bright enough on their
              own✨(Without the oil from the cheese being pressed into them by a
              wrapping)
            </p>

            <h4>Baja blast: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              If i ever go into a coma just tell the doctors to put this in my
              IV and it’ll bring me back. They should reverse engineer this
              stuff and maybe they’d fix cancer.

            During my visit, a worker was cleaning the tables and a manager or
            someone like that came out and told them to clean the window and
            wall behind a bench. The smell of the chemicals and talk of grease
            cleaning really complimented the god-tier elixir (baja blast) and
            the [deferred judgment] grilled cheese burrito. This has really made
            my taco bell experience. A true cherry on top.
          </p>

            This would be the end of my email but I’m waiting to see if the dood
            who just ordered and sat down is going to stay and eat or leave once
            he gets his food. Truly fascinating to observe the average taco bell
            enjoyer in the wild.

            Ah. A true taco bell fiend. He is enjoying his t bizzy alone in the
            restaurant. No shame. Just taco bell love. The taco bell experience
            of champions. He failed to get a drink and by extension, baja blast.
            Looks like he got a solid order otherwise. Review of my new taco
            bell enjoying friend: (9/10)

            I pulled up and the drive thru was packed. The t bizzy was looking t
            busy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also lots of cars in the parking lot so i was scared there would
            actually be people besides the one worker always on break in the
            fine dining area.<br />
            Felt like a lady in the drive thru was looking at me and judging me
            but if she was, her judgment means nothing because we’re both at
            taco bell.
          </p>
          <p>I go in, there were some people but a manageable amount.</p>
          <p>
            They forgot my drink so i snagged that boy. Filled it with the great
            blessings of heaven (baha blast)(my cup overfloweth) and took a
            seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            My last visit, they had carefully and lovingly placed the requested
            number of sauce packets of each variety in the box. This visit, upon
            opening the bag I discovered they used the handful method to count
            the sauces. Some might argue it’s the superior method but I withhold
            judgment.

            <h4>the chipotle ranch grilled chicken burrito:(4/10)</h4>
            <p>
              decent price but not that great. Not a fan of a lukewarm burrito.
              A little spicy- but not the “tastes good, glad it’s there” spicy
              and more just annoying spicy.
            </p>
            <h4>the go-to beefy 5:(this visit)(6/10)</h4>
            <p>
              decent I guess. Could’ve been warmer. kinda just made me want more
              (but better) taco bell(maybe the point?) not as good as the beefy
              5 i had earlier this week.
            </p>
            <h4>the baha blast:(Too good for my rank scheme/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Last but certainly not least- actually the best part. Got a large
              this time. It’s the same drink you get in the medium, and i’m
              still chilling in the lobby and will probably drink just as much
              either way, but there’s something special about the large- like
              the pride of paying 30 cents more for essentially the same thing.
              It makes it even more magical. When money’s tight, you gotta flex
              on the poors somehow.

            Hit my head 0 times (so far) on this visit.<br /><br /><br />
            (post t bizzy update)<br />
            As i was cleaning up I decided I wanted to take the sauce packets. I
            felt guilty for a moment until I realized they gave me that many and
            the sin was on the heads of the taco bell workers.<br />
            Got out to my car. Spilled glorious baja blast on my seat and suit.
            Tragic loss of baja blast. May those 4 fluid ounces rest in peace
            (in my 1997 rav 4 upholstery)
