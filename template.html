          <h3>12 October 2022</h3>
          <p>
            Ok ok i know i was here monday, but it‚Äôs for a good cause. Pre-fit
            check: valid‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ
          </p>
          <img src="images/12Oct2022/prefitcheck.jpeg" alt="Prefitcheck" />
          <p>
            I make my presence know at the t bizzy. Panic sets in when i realize
            some dood‚Äôs sitting where I usually do. Doesn‚Äôt he know who i am?
            Anyway, turns out this guy was a home boy. He was chowing down on a
            box, and before he left I asked him for the cardboard box that taco
            bell boxes come in and he gave it to me. Certified taco bell fiend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Order kinda taking forever. Makes me sad to sit in this taco bell
            and look at the decor that replaced the zesty and fun taco bell
            interiors of the past‚Ä¶üòû
          </p>
          <p>Oh FOOD‚Äôs READY LETS GOOO.</p>

          <p>Here‚Äôs the lowdown on the food:</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Fiesta potatoes:(whatever I gave them last time+2/10)</h4>
            <p>
              My friend taught me the method. Pouring sauce over them,
              re-lidding and shaking. Pretty good. I enjoyed the evenly
              distributed sour cream cheesey mild sauce over hot crispy potatoes
              a lotü§å Also added more sauce half way through.
            </p>
            <img
              src="images/12Oct2022/fiestapotatoes.jpeg"
              alt="Fiesta Potatoes method"
            />
            <h4>The bean burrito: (5/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Feels like the perfect score for this item. Default loadout taco
              bell. The taco bell elder. To be respected, but it‚Äôs
              evolutions/offspring are so much better. It really delivered on
              its promise though. Every bite was just like the one before and
              after it. Tortilla with a hint of refried beans and the distant
              thought of cheese. Out of left field came the onion though. I
              didn‚Äôt even know taco bell had onions??? Felt a little foreign in
              this burrito but added a nice bit of variety in flavor among a sea
              of B E A N.
            </p>
            <h4>Cheesy Gordita Crunch: (7/10)</h4>
            <p>
              The debate (among my fellow taco bell lovers) on the gordita
              crunch hasn‚Äôt been as heated as the grilled cheese burrito, but
              there seem to be strong feelings tied to it. Having never tried it
              myself I had a bit of skepticism. I unwrapped the crunch and i
              thought it was a joke. A cruel joke where someone just put a dummy
              thicc tortilla around a crunchy taco. Pretty sure that‚Äôs exactly
              what it is, but my experience was far better than a hard shell
              taco. The fat Tortilla really adds to the experience. It plays the
              same roll as the doritos advertising cardboard that comes with the
              doritos locos taco, holding the super crunchy tortilla together,
              but edible so it‚Äôs worlds better. I suspect the tortilla also
              helps keep the delicate taco warm longer. I ate this item last.
              Next time i get it i‚Äôll eat it first (so it‚Äôs warmer) and I
              suspect it will be even better.
            </p>
            <h4>Finally, baja blast: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              My light in the wilderness. The perfect wingman, conversation
              starter AND palate cleanser. The MP5 of sodas. Smooth and
              reliable. The apex of taco bell/ mountain dew engineering.
              Timeless, and loved the world over. Just makes the whole
              experience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            As i ate my bean burrito I thought about the experience of dressing
            up to visit taco bell. If I‚Äôm keeping it real- I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôd do
            it if someone else I knew was doing it too. Also might quit if
            someone tried to copy me. My theory is that the fun of being
            acoustic and dressing up for taco bell would be ruined if it seemed
            less acoustic (i.e. someone more normal than me doing it). That
            thought‚Äôs half baked though. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to ever copy me
            either.
          </p>
          <p>
            Head-on-light-fixture-contact count this time(so far): 0 I‚Äôm pleased
            to announce i will no longer be mentioning the light unless I hit it
            with my head again.

          <p>
            Ok pre game check. I thought i might hit the bell after FHE. Was
            already wearing nice pants so I brought my suit jacket. Perhaps gray
            on gray is a fashon crime. So what if i‚Äôm a criminal.
          </p>

          <p>(Rocking the brand new shirt)</p>
          <p>
            I pull up to t bizzy. They‚Äôre the fastest burrito makers in the
            west. (It took like 2 minutes from ordering) so i held off from
            ordering until being greeted by the overwhelming experience of the
            bell‚Äôs interior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entering the t bell, i saw all the regular sights, sounds and
            wonders. (Worker on break, soda drips all over the fountain machine,
            general mexican smell) but also took in the beauty of a taco bell
            ready for halloween. They basically have decorations everywhere and
            it really improves on the true mexican and day of the dead feel i‚Äôve
            come to expect.

          <div class="review">
            <h4>
              At the formal request (begging) and recommendation of multiple
              friends, I have given the grilled cheese burrito another chance.
              This is the third time: (Deferred judgment/10)
            </h4>
            <p>
              Honestly don‚Äôt think i can give the grilled cheese burrito a fair
              shake on this visit, despite coming exclusively to review it (and
              enjoy 4 gallons of baja blast). Just not feeling fantastic tonight
              so i‚Äôll hold off on the official bell review‚Ñ¢ score. Despite being
              made lightning fast and cracking into the burrito almost
              immediately, if wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbeefy 5 straight off the line‚Äù hot which I
              appreciate. Last time i said getting the large baja blast was the
              flex but no. It‚Äôs buying standalone items off the menu instead of
              getting them in a box. The burrito was decent. I think the worst
              part is the grease. I don‚Äôt think burritos from t bizzy should
              glisten(see below). They already shine bright enough on their
              own‚ú®(Without the oil from the cheese being pressed into them by a
              wrapping)
            </p>

            <h4>Baja blast: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              If i ever go into a coma just tell the doctors to put this in my
              IV and it‚Äôll bring me back. They should reverse engineer this
              stuff and maybe they‚Äôd fix cancer.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            During my visit, a worker was cleaning the tables and a manager or
            someone like that came out and told them to clean the window and
            wall behind a bench. The smell of the chemicals and talk of grease
            cleaning really complimented the god-tier elixir (baja blast) and
            the [deferred judgment] grilled cheese burrito. This has really made
            my taco bell experience. A true cherry on top.
          </p>
          <p>
            This would be the end of my email but I‚Äôm waiting to see if the dood
            who just ordered and sat down is going to stay and eat or leave once
            he gets his food. Truly fascinating to observe the average taco bell
            enjoyer in the wild.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ah. A true taco bell fiend. He is enjoying his t bizzy alone in the
            restaurant. No shame. Just taco bell love. The taco bell experience
            of champions. He failed to get a drink and by extension, baja blast.
            Looks like he got a solid order otherwise. Review of my new taco
            bell enjoying friend: (9/10)

            I pulled up and the drive thru was packed. The t bizzy was looking t
            busy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also lots of cars in the parking lot so i was scared there would
            actually be people besides the one worker always on break in the
            fine dining area.<br />
            Felt like a lady in the drive thru was looking at me and judging me
            but if she was, her judgment means nothing because we‚Äôre both at
            taco bell.
          </p>
          <p>I go in, there were some people but a manageable amount.</p>
          <p>
            They forgot my drink so i snagged that boy. Filled it with the great
            blessings of heaven (baha blast)(my cup overfloweth) and took a
            seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            My last visit, they had carefully and lovingly placed the requested
            number of sauce packets of each variety in the box. This visit, upon
            opening the bag I discovered they used the handful method to count
            the sauces. Some might argue it‚Äôs the superior method but I withhold
            judgment.

            <h4>the chipotle ranch grilled chicken burrito:(4/10)</h4>
            <p>
              decent price but not that great. Not a fan of a lukewarm burrito.
              A little spicy- but not the ‚Äútastes good, glad it‚Äôs there‚Äù spicy
              and more just annoying spicy.
            </p>
            <h4>the go-to beefy 5:(this visit)(6/10)</h4>
            <p>
              decent I guess. Could‚Äôve been warmer. kinda just made me want more
              (but better) taco bell(maybe the point?) not as good as the beefy
              5 i had earlier this week.
            </p>
            <h4>the baha blast:(Too good for my rank scheme/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Last but certainly not least- actually the best part. Got a large
              this time. It‚Äôs the same drink you get in the medium, and i‚Äôm
              still chilling in the lobby and will probably drink just as much
              either way, but there‚Äôs something special about the large- like
              the pride of paying 30 cents more for essentially the same thing.
              It makes it even more magical. When money‚Äôs tight, you gotta flex
              on the poors somehow.

            Hit my head 0 times (so far) on this visit.<br /><br /><br />
            (post t bizzy update)<br />
            As i was cleaning up I decided I wanted to take the sauce packets. I
            felt guilty for a moment until I realized they gave me that many and
            the sin was on the heads of the taco bell workers.<br />
            Got out to my car. Spilled glorious baja blast on my seat and suit.
            Tragic loss of baja blast. May those 4 fluid ounces rest in peace
            (in my 1997 rav 4 upholstery)
