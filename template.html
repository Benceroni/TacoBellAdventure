          <p>Straight after stake conference.</p>
          <p>With a bunch of people from the ward.</p>
          <p>
            Orders have taken like 25 minutes so far.<br />
            My heart’s not in this review. I’m super distracted.

            <h4>Fiesta potatoes:(7/10)</h4>
            <p>Good. Sauced em.</p>
            <h4>Bence’s beefy 5:(6/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Probably a mistake to get it this trip. It’s a beefy 5 burrito
              with rice swapped for beans. Hoping to get quesarito vibes but it
              missed. Thought it was pretty good when I was paying attention. I
              think the beans are the weakest part of the beefy 5. Also waited
              forever to eat it so it might be better hotter.
            </p>
            <h4>Cheesy Gordita crunch: (good/10)</h4>
            <p>I refuse to elaborate.</p>
            <h4>Rice and bean burrito: (0/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I got 2 bites in and the interior was so liquid-ous that I tapped
              out. Wrapped it up and threw it away. Goodbye the worst burrito
              i’ve ever had at taco bell🤝
            </p>
            <h4>Baja blast: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>I’m done</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Probably the worst taco bell visit this week. That soupy burrito
            really was the cherry on top. The hype for barbie(2023)(starring
            Ryan Gosling) hit a new high for me today though.

          <p>
            It’s been a weird trip to taco bell.<br />
            Wait- prefit check
          </p>

          <img

          />
          <p>Ok back to the wack</p>
          <p>
            When I pulled up at the bell- I walk in the place and there’s A GOTH
            GIRL. She’s wasn’t exactly in “my seat” but I wasn’t just gonna pull
            up and sit myself right next to 2 girls talking about the goth
            girl’s employment.<br />
            That would’ve been the chad move tho😔
          </p>
          <p>I will repent🫡🤝😎</p>
          <p>
            I plop down in a different spot and try ordering on the app and it
            said something in my cart wasn’t available- so i try removing things
            one by one until I’m down to just baja blast and it said the store
            isn’t open at this hour. Really confusing. I try the kiosk and
            everything’s grayed out so I ACTUALLY HAD TO TALK TO A WORKER.
          </p>
          <p>Here’s where the sauce meme i’m going to make goes.</p>

          />
          <p>Here’s what I got:</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Spicy potato soft taco: (9/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Took a victory lap by getting this one. Knew it would smack. It
              did. Case closed🤝 After smacking lips with the spicy potato soft
              taco I saw a message from the mild sauce. I think it likes me😏
            </p>
            <img
              src="images/28Oct2022/image0 (12).jpeg"
              alt="the mild sauce is into me fr fr"
              loading="lazy"
            />
            <h4>Double steak grilled cheese burrito: (8/10)</h4>
            <p>This thing was hefty. In price and size.</p>
            <img
              src="images/28Oct2022/image2 (11).jpeg"
              alt="(banana for scale)"

            />
            <p>
              (Sauce packet for scale)<br />
              It slapped too. I was kinda skeptical for a few reason. Not a fan
              of the grease on the grilled cheese burrito and hated the steak on
              the nacho truff fries, but this thing delivered. I used the paper
              to hold it and the grease didn’t bother me at all. Gave me grilled
              cheese burrito vibes and I really enjoyed it. The chipotle sauce
              is so good.
            </p>
            <h4>Baja blast: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I went and filled my cup and the aroma of it hit me and I don’t
              think i’ve been the same since👍👍👍

          <p>
            I noticed something. I prefer biting the right side of my burritos.
            I just watched myself turn the burito 180 degrees so I could bite
            the right side instead of the left. I think this right side
            preference comes from me primarily holding burritos in my left hand,
            and using the precision of my right hand to apply sauce in proper
            sauce proportions.
          </p>
          <p>Food:</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Beefy melt burrito: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Maybe this comes from being in a low place but this burrito was SO
              GOOD. The rice, the cheese. The other things. Perfection. Even the
              blob of sour cream at the bottom provided an interesting second
              half. This is the first time i’ve noticed a taco bell item have a
              glob of sour cream at only one end. I don’t give the 10/10
              lightly. I think there was only one bite that didn’t fill me with
              joy.
            </p>
            <h4>Cheesy bean and rice burrito: (6/10)</h4>
            <p>
              First half was STRAIGHT bean. Second half had some rice and cheese
              too. First half was a 5/10. Second half a 7/10.
            </p>
            <h4>The quesarito: (8/10)</h4>
            <p>
              This thing was bomb. I ordered all these items individually and
              the quesarito is like 4$ but it was worth it. Gave me grilled
              cheese burrito vibes too, particularly on the second half. I think
              the chipotle sauce wasn’t evenly distributed and it only hit me
              the second half. Another heavy hitting heavenly taco bell item.
            </p>
            <h4>Baja blast: (😇/10)</h4>
            <p>
              A heavenly experience. The good old baja blast hit the spot.
              Especially when i over filled the cup, then put the lid on and
              some of it spilled down the sides and out the straw hole onto the
              lid and i kinda sucked it up off the top. That was really good.
              The first sip was really good too.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The rice really carried this meal. The true 2nd MVP behind the
            blast. I want to get a beefy 5 with rice instead of beans. I spilled
            baja blast on my suit and tie this trip.

          <h3>25 October 2022</h3>
          <p>
            This is an emotionally charged taco bell visit. Lots of 🅱️encer lore
            too.
          </p>
          <p>
            The brake master cylinder on my 1997 toyota rav4’s not doing too
            hot. I got the part in and went to replace it with a friend.
            Discovered half way through i had the wrong brake master cylinder😐
            got the car put back together and felt terrible about not
            accomplishing what I set out to do so I decided to hit the bell.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn’t really want to eat and wasn’t even craving the bell but i
            knew i needed to eat and felt like going anyway. Kinda sounds like
            an addiction but…🤫
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, i pull up to the holy bell. Off cole and overland- by the
            temple. Parking lot is packed. Drive thru is bussin. (Here’s the pre
            fit check)(clothes I didn’t care about getting greasy)(car or taco
            bell grease)
          </p>
          <img

          />
          <p>
            The taco bell's interior was flowing with taco bell patrons. No idea
            if these people were true taco bell fans either. The seat i usually
            sit at’s open but someone’s also sitting a table over. All good, no
            problem. I go to order on the app and decide to go for the app
            exclusive box. That’s when i see the disclaimer. “This t bizzy
            location closing in 7 minutes dawg. No app ordering allowed.” TACO
            BELL CLOSING AT 7????? Literally 1984. I peaced the f*tch out dawg.
            I was DONE with that location and all those wanna be taco bell
            lovers.
          </p>
          <p>
            So i drove down overland. I hit autozone and bought some rain-x
            wiper blades. Listened to some jams and drove to the true bell.
          </p>

          />
          <p>I ordered the mobile exclusive box. A solid deal.</p>
          <p>
            I went to the bathroom and cleaned up the absolute pile of paper
            towels around the garbage can. Gotta look out for a taco-homie🤝.
            The paper towel was still in the urial that was there yesterday
            too😐
          </p>
          <p>
            Order check:<br />
            Name called - “Benson”<br />
            Sauce packets i ordered - 7 (mild)<br />
            Sauce packets I got - 0 (also mild)<br />
            Forks in bag - 0 (very relevant later)<br />
            Cups i had to ask for - 1 (medium)
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon filling my cup i grabbed a lid. I kinda manhandled the lid
            below the one i grabbed too. Gross to think about. Then it dawned on
            me that the two lids I touched weren’t properly in the stack so
            someone else had probably touched mine.<br />
            Such is the nature of “The cycle of manhandling lids”<br />
            I hate the containers the lids at this taco bell are kept in
            too🙂<br />
            I’m usually pretty good about throwing away lids I touch and don’t
            use.
          </p>
          <p>Sob story’s over. Time for the good stuff</p>

            <h4>Spicy potato taco: (9/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I’ve had this before and didn’t remember really liking it, but the
              first bite was heaven. Actually the first half was heaven. It gave
              me barbecue chip vibes and i love me some barbecue chips. The hot
              chip is to the latina girl as the barbecue chip is to the white
              boy. Potatoes were a nice texture too. The spice was right on the
              edge between good and annoying. Probably the biggest upset in taco
              bell reviews seen this taco bell season.
            </p>
            <h4>Fiesta potatoes: (6/10)</h4>
            <p>
              (what i needed the fork for)<br />
              The potatoes today were alright. I applied the taco bell doctrine
              learned last time and put 4 sauces on before mixing. It didn’t all
              mix together correctly but I can’t complain about getting a packed
              fiesta potatoes container😏 Potatoes were a bit soft. Added
              another sauce by the end and enjoyed the last few bites a lot.
            </p>
            <h4>Crunchwrap supreme: (8/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Another upset tonight. It’s truly been quite the taco bell
              experience. I’m glad i gave the crunchwrap another try because i
              was pleasantly surprised. It was consistently warm. The hardshell
              tostada inside provided me the taste of a hardshell taco without
              the mess and the ingredients delivered a classic taco bell taste.
              Cannot complain. On the last bite i ran out of sauce. So i went
              and grabbed another packet.
            </p>
            <h4>Baja blast: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>Tastes (tasted) really good</p>
            <h4>Baja blast shivers: (0/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I’m COLD DAWG. I went out to the car and grabbed another jacket
              and I’m STILL cold. Not even the shivers can stop me from the
              cool, refreshing, invigorating, dream defying, car fixing, and
              revelatory experience of baja blast😎
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            When i was almost finished writing my reviews, the taco bell worker
            called my name. (Spencer, not bencer) It seems there’s another
            customer named Spencer. He looks like soap from modern warfare.<br />

            The shivers are real. I’m fr really cold rn.<br />

            Made some art today too.

            I came straight from FHE so i had to make some serious strategic

            Inside the bell was cozy. Warm shelter from the drip(my fit)

            Not only was it temporally comforting, but it felt traditional too.
            Empty. Kinda sorta clean. The one worker on break sipping
            gatorade(another great mystery of taco bell’s drink selection) and
            facetiming someone in spanish way too loud. Home sweet home.

            Dolly parton’s mexican pizza musical advertisement meme inspired me
            to order the mexican pizza today. I remember getting it once on the
            mission, and also remember the astounding disappointment I
            experienced at the time. Needless to say the bar was low.

            When my food was ready, the worker hesitantly called out “bencer”. A

            I had to ask for a cup. I was hopeful the sauce was already in there
            but I should’ve known that having to ask for the cup was a bad sign
            because they used the worst, but perhaps most common sauce counting
            method. The SIUaDIY sauce counting method. (Suck It Up and Do It
            Yourself). It’s ok😞 i’m used to it. I decided to counter with the
            double handful counting method to stick it to em.

          <div class="review">
            <h4>Mexican pizza: (5/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I feel that all enjoyment came from the low bar. It’s Like a hard
              shell taco with tons of ground beef and cooked extra long.
              Probably about as good as a hard shell taco. Maybe a smidge
              better. A common thread throughout the food i try, but the mild
              sauce carried it.
            </p>
            <h4>The nacho fries: (7/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Not feeling them as much today. Still good though. I ended up
              mixing 4 sauces into the cheese sauce since the cheese was dummy
              thicc. My experience with the cheese sauce taught me some true
              taco bell doctrine. The sauce doctrine- never too much taco bell
              sauce Which called back and reinforced another taco bell truth:
              “True [taco bell] doctrine, understood, changes [taco bell orders]
              faster than a study of [taco bell orders] changes [taco bell
              orders]”

            <p>
              I figured the review would be more interesting if I switched it
              up.<br />
              The supreme DLT wasn’t all crumbled like the last time. Already a
              win. The sour cream on it was good. I definitely enjoyed it more
              that the regular DLT but I don’t know if It was worth the premium.
              Maybe I could just bring my own sour cream next time.

            At this point in my taco bell adventure, i took a moment to breathe
            and relax and enjoy the taco bell atmosphere. The lobby was still
            empty at this point in the journey. The warmth of the bell really
            helps to counter the gallons of ice cold baja blast i down.

              I don’t know chief. I really didn’t want to back down from the t
              bizzy challenge. I was feeling really full though. My bull headed
              taco bell nature pushed me though. I took a few bites and… gave
              up. It wasn’t stellar either. Probably like a 2/10 if i did give
              it a rating. I kept trying to eat it as i wrote this review but it
              got kinda crusty and only tasted like refried beans. Not even
              sauce could save this one boss. Tragic.

            During this visit I started to wonder if my reviews are just the
            same joke over and over. Maybe. Taco bell never fails to excite
            though.
          </p>
          <p>
            For some reason my phone got super greasy this trip. Maybe the

            One of the great mysteries of taco bell is this: how can I pull up
            to a taco bell that has no cars in the drive thru and nobody waiting
            for food in the lobby and still wait forever for my food??? I don’t

            Got the nacho fries box. Swapped the hardshell for a soft. Late
            night snack of champions:

          <div class="review">
            <h4>Nacho fries: (9/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Ok this time I mixed the mild sauce in with cheese sauce and it
              was what’s up. Truly thinking outside the bun here. It’s in my
              DNA. The thinner sauce really complimented the fries and bumped up
              the score.
            </p>
            <h4>Soft taco: (7/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Pretty good. Nothing special. The mild sauce really carried it
              though. Seems to be a trend around here. Better than a hardshell
              taco but not peak taco bell
            </p>
            <h4>Beefy 5: (I’m tired of scoring the beefy 5)</h4>
            <p>
              This beefy 5 did the job. Mopped up the last of the mild sauce
              cheese sauce. Really carried this taco bell experience in terms of
              satiation. Still haven’t figured out if the beefy 5 or this taco
              bell experience has filled my heart though.

            There’s currently 8 people in the lobby waiting for doordash orders.
            I pitty those without the courage the venture to the bell
            themselves. To confront the dragon of t bizzy chaos. To get the
            golden cheese sauce(and to mix it with mild sauce for perfect nacho
            fries). (More knights of the crunchwrap’s templar lore coming soon)

            The bell was tolling for me all day at work. I got home, took care
            of boxes and put on the tbizzy fit.<br />
            “Hello my name is Spencer. I’m a recovering taco bell addict. It’s
            been 4 days since i’ve rung the bell” Well. Now it’s 0 haha
          </p>

          <p>
            Before coming to the bell I remembered some other stuff I needed to
            take care of. Decided to just hit the bell and deal with it later.

            The bell was suspiciously clean today. No sauce artwork on the
            tables or lettuce landmines on the floor. My order was pretty quick.
            Nice 👍. I saw a real miracle too. There were some individuals here
            who appeared to be of hispanic descent. That’s how I know this place
            is valid✅✅✅
          </p>
          <p>
            When my order was ready the worker holding the box spotted me and
            put the dots together. We have achieved recognition. The box was
            feeling STUFFED too. Nice😎

            No wonder they’re reasonably priced still😞😞😞- there’s like 11
            real ones and a few fragments. Sadness aside, this cost less than my
            last trip where i only paid for a quesarito and truff nacho fries.
            Solid value💸
          </p>
          <p>
            I requested 12 sauces and they gave me 11. Close enough. Feeling
            proud of my taco bell workers🫡🫡🫡
          </p>
          <p>Here’s the juicy deets on the eats:</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Nacho fries:(8/10)</h4>
            <p>
              The 13 fries i got were pretty good. (Didn’t actually count) I ate
              them first since I figured they’d get cold fast. Despite eating
              them immediately they weren’t mouth burning and I appreciate that.
              Solid flavor, good with sauce and queso dip. Glad they back. Not
              sure if they’re better than the grilled cheese burrito. It was
              ripped from my grilled cheese greasy hands before i could truly
              make up my mind.
            </p>
            <h4>Doritos locos taco: (5/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Probably a downside of the stuffed box but it took the pleasure of
              falling apart before i got to it and it wasn’t as good as usual.
              Roll of the dice and shake of the taco I guess. We all fall apart
              sometimes and i’m sure it’ll be better next time.
            </p>
            <h4>Chalupa supreme- steak: (3/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I think this is my first time having a steak chalupa supreme but i
              did not enjoy it. The steak reminded me of really cheap elementary
              school meals and the tomatoes were a little bitter. Perhaps the
              first time I didn’t really want to finish an item at taco bell.
            </p>
            <h4>Beefy 5: (6/10)</h4>
            <p>
              My hopes were riding high when I started on this boy. The fries
              were good but i had just taken 2 L’s with the taco and chalupa.
              The beefy 5 didn’t deliver though. The expectations: too high. The
              weight: too much. The burrito folded. It was just ok. Not
              fantastic, not terrible, and certainly not enough to make up for
              the 2 blunders before it. I’m sorry beefy 5. The mild sauce on it
              took it from a 5 to a 6 tho.
            </p>

            *dude walks in- with his wife- and approaches the counter*<br />
            “You guys start making the encharitos yet?”<br />

          <p>
            Eh. The trip to taco bell was a solid value but disappointing. Kinda
            don’t want to get the deluxe nacho fries cravings box again. Or swap
            out the steak for chicken or beef on the chalupa if I do. That was
            painful 😖<br />
            I went through 6 mild sauce packets. I couldn’t sworn i used more.
            Maybe my experience could’ve been better if i had used all 11.

            Today was a 20 mile trip to taco bell and a quick stop to take a few

            the kids aren’t good at not staring or talking about people in same
            room quietly yet. I finally got my order and I was kinda done
            listening to the 15 other people here so i put in my earbuds.
            Mindecraft music go hard.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems they may have figured out that i just eat my order in the
            lobby and didn’t fill my drink this time.(could also be wrong about
            that because there’s been a baja blast sitting on the mobile pickup
            shelf almost the entire time i’ve been here)
          </p>
          <p>I went to fill my drink and… tragedy struck.</p>

            I was going to get another grilled cheese burrito but true tragedy
            struck. It seems in getting nacho fries back, i lost the opportunity
            to try the grilled cheese burrito again. Sadness.

          <div class="review">
            <h4>Quesarito: (7/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Pretty solid. A hefty price tho. The first bite was cloud 9. It
              felt like what I imagine taco bell is when i’m craving it. The
              rest of the burrito was ok. Kinda seemed like a grilled cheese
              burrito without the grilled cheese or purple fritos.
            </p>
            <h4>Loaded truff nacho fries: (3/10)</h4>
            <p>
              The truff hot sauce isn’t anything special. I took one bite before
              absolutely smothering it in mild sauce. It was bearable after that
              but i’m not getting it again. Also kinda expensive for like 12
              fries with some cheese, 2 tiny strips of steak, sour cream and mid
              tier hot sauce. Never getting them again.

            <h4>Baja blast: (8/10)</h4>
            <p>
              that score is a lie. Just trying to keep you on your toes and see
              if you’re paying attention. Baja blast is the one true drink. The
              cause for which we war against the del taco infidels. Our
              connection to life and beauty and all her blessings. Without baja
              life wouldn’t be worth living. Baja blast wills it. Long live the
              baja.
            </p>
            <h4>Minecraft music at the bell: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Besides the blast, it’s the only redeeming factor of coming to
              taco bell dressed like… well dressed the way I am.

          <h3>12 October 2022</h3>
          <p>
            Ok ok i know i was here monday, but it’s for a good cause.
            <br />Pre-fit check: valid✅✅✅
          </p>
          <img src="images/12Oct2022/prefitcheck.jpeg" alt="Prefitcheck" />
          <p>
            I make my presence know at the t bizzy. Panic sets in when i realize
            some dood’s sitting where I usually do. Doesn’t he know who i am?
            Anyway, turns out this guy was a home boy. He was chowing down on a
            box, and before he left I asked him for the cardboard box that taco
            bell boxes come in and he gave it to me. Certified taco bell fiend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Order kinda taking forever. Makes me sad to sit in this taco bell
            and look at the decor that replaced the zesty and fun taco bell
            interiors of the past…😞
          </p>
          <p>Oh FOOD’s READY LETS GOOO.</p>

          <p>Here’s the lowdown on the food:</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Fiesta potatoes:(whatever I gave them last time+2/10)</h4>
            <p>
              My friend taught me the method. Pouring sauce over them,
              re-lidding and shaking. Pretty good. I enjoyed the evenly
              distributed sour cream cheesey mild sauce over hot crispy potatoes
              a lot🤌 Also added more sauce half way through.
            </p>

              loading="lazy"
            />
            <h4>The bean burrito: (5/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Feels like the perfect score for this item. Default loadout taco
              bell. The taco bell elder. To be respected, but it’s
              evolutions/offspring are so much better. It really delivered on
              its promise though. Every bite was just like the one before and
              after it. Tortilla with a hint of refried beans and the distant
              thought of cheese. Out of left field came the onion though. I
              didn’t even know taco bell had onions??? Felt a little foreign in
              this burrito but added a nice bit of variety in flavor among a sea
              of B E A N.
            </p>
            <h4>Cheesy Gordita Crunch: (7/10)</h4>
            <p>
              The debate (among my fellow taco bell lovers) on the gordita
              crunch hasn’t been as heated as the grilled cheese burrito, but
              there seem to be strong feelings tied to it. Having never tried it
              myself I had a bit of skepticism. I unwrapped the crunch and i
              thought it was a joke. A cruel joke where someone just put a dummy
              thicc tortilla around a crunchy taco. Pretty sure that’s exactly
              what it is, but my experience was far better than a hard shell
              taco. The fat Tortilla really adds to the experience. It plays the
              same roll as the doritos advertising cardboard that comes with the
              doritos locos taco, holding the super crunchy tortilla together,
              but edible so it’s worlds better. I suspect the tortilla also
              helps keep the delicate taco warm longer. I ate this item last.
              Next time i get it i’ll eat it first (so it’s warmer) and I
              suspect it will be even better.
            </p>
            <h4>Finally, baja blast: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              My light in the wilderness. The perfect wingman, conversation
              starter AND palate cleanser. The MP5 of sodas. Smooth and
              reliable. The apex of taco bell/ mountain dew engineering.
              Timeless, and loved the world over. Just makes the whole
              experience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            As i ate my bean burrito I thought about the experience of dressing
            up to visit taco bell. If I’m keeping it real- I don’t think i’d do
            it if someone else I knew was doing it too. Also might quit if
            someone tried to copy me. My theory is that the fun of being
            acoustic and dressing up for taco bell would be ruined if it seemed
            less acoustic (i.e. someone more normal than me doing it). That
            thought’s half baked though. I don’t expect anyone to ever copy me
            either.
          </p>
          <p>
            Head-on-light-fixture-contact count this time(so far): 0 I’m pleased
            to announce i will no longer be mentioning the light unless I hit it
            with my head again.

            Ok pre game check. I thought i might hit the bell after FHE. Was
            already wearing nice pants so I brought my suit jacket. Perhaps gray
            on gray is a fashon crime. So what if i’m a criminal.

            I pull up to t bizzy. They’re the fastest burrito makers in the
            west. (It took like 2 minutes from ordering) so i held off from
            ordering until being greeted by the overwhelming experience of the
            bell’s interior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entering the t bell, i saw all the regular sights, sounds and
            wonders. (Worker on break, soda drips all over the fountain machine,
            general mexican smell) but also took in the beauty of a taco bell
            ready for halloween. They basically have decorations everywhere and
            it really improves on the true mexican and day of the dead feel i’ve
            come to expect.

            </h4>
            <p>
              Honestly don’t think i can give the grilled cheese burrito a fair
              shake on this visit, despite coming exclusively to review it (and
              enjoy 4 gallons of baja blast). Just not feeling fantastic tonight
              so i’ll hold off on the official bell review™ score. Despite being
              made lightning fast and cracking into the burrito almost
              immediately, if wasn’t “beefy 5 straight off the line” hot which I
              appreciate. Last time i said getting the large baja blast was the
              flex but no. It’s buying standalone items off the menu instead of
              getting them in a box. The burrito was decent. I think the worst
              part is the grease. I don’t think burritos from t bizzy should
              glisten(see below). They already shine bright enough on their
              own✨(Without the oil from the cheese being pressed into them by a
              wrapping)

              If i ever go into a coma just tell the doctors to put this in my
              IV and it’ll bring me back. They should reverse engineer this
              stuff and maybe they’d fix cancer.

            During my visit, a worker was cleaning the tables and a manager or
            someone like that came out and told them to clean the window and
            wall behind a bench. The smell of the chemicals and talk of grease
            cleaning really complimented the god-tier elixir (baja blast) and
            the [deferred judgment] grilled cheese burrito. This has really made
            my taco bell experience. A true cherry on top.

            This would be the end of my email but I’m waiting to see if the dood
            who just ordered and sat down is going to stay and eat or leave once
            he gets his food. Truly fascinating to observe the average taco bell
            enjoyer in the wild.

            Ah. A true taco bell fiend. He is enjoying his t bizzy alone in the
            restaurant. No shame. Just taco bell love. The taco bell experience
            of champions. He failed to get a drink and by extension, baja blast.
            Looks like he got a solid order otherwise. Review of my new taco

            I pulled up and the drive thru was packed. The t bizzy was looking t
            busy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also lots of cars in the parking lot so i was scared there would
            actually be people besides the one worker always on break in the
            fine dining area.<br />
            Felt like a lady in the drive thru was looking at me and judging me
            but if she was, her judgment means nothing because we’re both at
            taco bell.
          </p>
          <p>I go in, there were some people but a manageable amount.</p>
          <p>
            They forgot my drink so i snagged that boy. Filled it with the great
            blessings of heaven (baha blast)(my cup overfloweth) and took a
            seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            My last visit, they had carefully and lovingly placed the requested
            number of sauce packets of each variety in the box. This visit, upon
            opening the bag I discovered they used the handful method to count
            the sauces. Some might argue it’s the superior method but I withhold
            judgment.

            <h4>the chipotle ranch grilled chicken burrito:(4/10)</h4>
            <p>
              decent price but not that great. Not a fan of a lukewarm burrito.
              A little spicy- but not the “tastes good, glad it’s there” spicy
              and more just annoying spicy.

            <h4>the go-to beefy 5:(this visit)(6/10)</h4>

              decent I guess. Could’ve been warmer. kinda just made me want more
              (but better) taco bell(maybe the point?) not as good as the beefy
              5 i had earlier this week.

              Last but certainly not least- actually the best part. Got a large
              this time. It’s the same drink you get in the medium, and i’m
              still chilling in the lobby and will probably drink just as much
              either way, but there’s something special about the large- like
              the pride of paying 30 cents more for essentially the same thing.
              It makes it even more magical. When money’s tight, you gotta flex
              on the poors somehow.

            (post t bizzy update)<br />
            As i was cleaning up I decided I wanted to take the sauce packets. I
            felt guilty for a moment until I realized they gave me that many and
            the sin was on the heads of the taco bell workers.<br />
            Got out to my car. Spilled glorious baja blast on my seat and suit.
            Tragic loss of baja blast. May those 4 fluid ounces rest in peace
