            I pulled up and the drive thru was packed. The t bizzy was looking t
            busy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also lots of cars in the parking lot so i was scared there would
            actually be people besides the one worker always on break in the
            fine dining area.<br />
            Felt like a lady in the drive thru was looking at me and judging me
            but if she was, her judgment means nothing because we’re both at
            taco bell.
          </p>
          <p>I go in, there were some people but a manageable amount.</p>
          <p>
            They forgot my drink so i snagged that boy. Filled it with the great
            blessings of heaven (baha blast)(my cup overfloweth) and took a
            seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            My last visit, they had carefully and lovingly placed the requested
            number of sauce packets of each variety in the box. This visit, upon
            opening the bag I discovered they used the handful method to count
            the sauces. Some might argue it’s the superior method but I withhold
            judgment.

            <h4>the chipotle ranch grilled chicken burrito:(4/10)</h4>
            <p>
              decent price but not that great. Not a fan of a lukewarm burrito.
              A little spicy- but not the “tastes good, glad it’s there” spicy
              and more just annoying spicy.
            </p>
            <h4>the go-to beefy 5:(this visit)(6/10)</h4>
            <p>
              decent I guess. Could’ve been warmer. kinda just made me want more
              (but better) taco bell(maybe the point?) not as good as the beefy
              5 i had earlier this week.
            </p>
            <h4>the baha blast:(Too good for my rank scheme/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Last but certainly not least- actually the best part. Got a large
              this time. It’s the same drink you get in the medium, and i’m
              still chilling in the lobby and will probably drink just as much
              either way, but there’s something special about the large- like
              the pride of paying 30 cents more for essentially the same thing.
              It makes it even more magical. When money’s tight, you gotta flex
              on the poors somehow.

            Hit my head 0 times (so far) on this visit.<br /><br /><br />
            (post t bizzy update)<br />
            As i was cleaning up I decided I wanted to take the sauce packets. I
            felt guilty for a moment until I realized they gave me that many and
            the sin was on the heads of the taco bell workers.<br />
            Got out to my car. Spilled glorious baja blast on my seat and suit.
            Tragic loss of baja blast. May those 4 fluid ounces rest in peace
            (in my 1997 rav 4 upholstery)
