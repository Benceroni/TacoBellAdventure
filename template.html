          <h3>9 December 2022</h3>
          <p>
            Got off work. Brother was coming over for a haircut and to talk with
            me. I knew i wanted to hit the bell so I didn‚Äôt eat. Once he got
            there I checked and saw taco bell closed at 8 so i skipped talking
            with my brother.

            (I hope the hunger is clear in the photo)<br />I got out of my car
            again to take this photo
          </p>
          <p>
            Pull up to the bell.<br />
            This individual‚Äôs interior was CLOSED.<br />
            So salty.<br />
            Thought i‚Äôd try the one by winco on meridian.

            <h4>Orange chicken: (Ë≥áË®ä/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I think i ate too much because I don‚Äôt feel good. Panda Express
              hits different then the bell and I miscalculatedüò≥üòì
            </p>
            <h4>Orange chicken 2: (honey this time)(Êèõ/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Also good. The chicken experience just kinda all blended together
              in my mind.
            </p>
            <h4>Chow mein:(Ë≥á/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I know that score might be controversial but I think it really
              deserves it. Overestimates by some, underestimated by others. I
              think the score I gave is right where it belongs.

          </div>
          <p>
            I don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôll hit panda again.<br />It was good. I don‚Äôt know
            how much I‚Äôve enjoyed it but maybe i‚Äôll keep it in my pocket. Panda
            express might actually have more ingredients arranged in different
            ways to make new items but it feels like taco bell has more variety.
            Perhaps a hot take but i‚Äôve been full of those
            tonight(„Ç´„Çø„Ç´„Éäü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£)

          <h3>
            The seventh day in the twelfth month of the year two thousand and
            twenty-two
          </h3>
          <p>
            Here am I, again.<br />
            Having spent many hours laboring diligently(kinda-sort of) at the
            land of the lion‚Äôs bridge, having discovered many bugs(none
            actually),had much want for food. Therefore i journeyed many miles
            and suffered much congestion (like half a mile on overland before
            eagle) to arrive at the land of my fathers, even the bell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having much want for food, i considered the abandonment of my purity
            in writing, after mine fathers language, but i shall persist in my
            manor of writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now i shall show for your consideration the outfit upon me in my
            journeying before the bell
          </p>
          <img
            src="images/7Dec2022/image0 (35).jpeg"

          />
          <p>
            This photo, having been captured in the moment of congestion when
            the truck i followest began to proceed, was taken in great haste.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon arrival at the land of the bell, to my great astonishment and
            to my desire, I discovered the lobby before me was not desolate and
            welcoming to the weary traveler unlike in the former two nights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having taken refuge in the lobby of the bell, i considered my
            cravings, and ordered mine order.
          </p>
          <p>
            The order of the bell was delivered in a nature which was speedy.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            (My countenance captured at the time of mine order‚Äôs deliverance to
            me)
          </p>
          <p>
            Having ordered the Lord‚Äôs chosen item,(nacho fries) i designed to
            chow down upon them without delay.
          </p>
          <p>My account in the land of plenty:</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Celestial nacho fries: (9/10)</h4>
            <p>
              These fries, having been eaten in haste, delighted me much. And
              the sauce, it‚Äôs purity being preserved and not marred by mild
              sauce, delivered a cheesy sensation known to few, but loved by
              those who are of such knowledge. (Bussin fr fr)
            </p>
            <h4>The taco which is crunchy(thought i‚Äôd mix things up):(5/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Mine obligations to finish my meal carried me through this sore
              item. It retained its integrity of the shell throughout its
              consumption. A noble deed but not so much as to deserve more than
              a 5/10, in spite of the valiance of the sauce which is mild
              accompanying each bite.
            </p>
            <h4>The beefy 7 of bence: (7/10)</h4>
            <img
              src="images/7Dec2022/image2 (20).jpeg"
              alt="big boym at the bell"
              loading="lazy"
            />
            <p>
              The big boym beefy of 7 was found lacking. Fallen short of its
              former glory and stature. Failing to deliver the vibes of
              quesarito and grilled cheese burrito as it did in days of old.
              Surely such days of insufficiency fall upon all who aim upward,
              and as such, the beefy 7 shall be given a pass for its failure
              this day.
            </p>
            <h4>Blast of the baja of the exclusivity of the bell:(10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              It‚Äôs sweetness, having graced my lips, delivered unto me the
              sensations left to be found else only in the heavens. It‚Äôs aroma,
              calling to it the attention of the senses, brings with it life at
              each breath.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            I shall now offer much praise and thanks for the blessing it has
            been to experience the dining establishment of mine fathers.<br />
            My weariness: wiped away.<br />
            My want for food: satisfied.<br />
            My hope: restorethed.<br />

          <h3>2 December 2022</h3>
          <p>Back here again. I know it‚Äôs been a while since i‚Äôve been here.</p>
          <p>Here the pre-fit check</p>

          <img
            src="images/2Dec2022/image0 (34).jpeg"

          />
          <p>
            I pulled up. Parked in the compact parking spot since my car
            basically fits in my pocket. The place was almost emptyüòéüòéüòé<br />
            A win in my book.
          </p>
          <p>
            No kiosk today. I ordered at the counter. Just a single burrito for
            this go around- they didn‚Äôt wrap it though???
          </p>
          <img
            src="images/2Dec2022/image1 (26).jpeg"
            alt="me at the bell"
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <p>The food:</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Sweet pork burrito: (7/10)</h4>
            <p>
              First bite had no mild sauce- pretty good. The rest of it was like
              the first bite but with half a container of sauce on it.
            </p>
            <h4>The lettuce and tomatoes on the side: (5/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they‚Äôre good, but it feels like a chore to
              eat. Like an ad on to your burrito experience that usually is just
              in the burrito. It provides a sense of guilt (something I severely
              lack of course) as i look down at my meal and see there‚Äôs way more
              lettuce and tomato left then burrito.
            </p>
            <h4>Baja blast: (6/10)</h4>
            <p>Tasted kinda funny today.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Mid meal event:<br />
            As i was eating a dude sat down at the table next to mine in a suit:
            niceüòé
          </p>
          <p>
            As i‚Äôve been writing this, someone I know from the home ward showed
            up. Definitely made eye contact with him and I don‚Äôt think the
            recognition is there on his end and i feel invisible. I love the
            feeling. Like being a bush people don‚Äôt look at twice as they pass
            on the street.
          </p>
          <p>
            This store phone in front of me won‚Äôt stop ringing. Part of me
            REALLY wants to see if their newest employee (me) can enter a
            customer order correctlyüòà
          </p>
          <p>Baja isn‚Äôt hitting right tonight. Still making me cold though.</p>
          <p>Good trip üëç</p>
          <p>Post game update:</p>
          <p>
            Definitely just smacked my head on the light. In the bathroom this
            time tho

          <p>
            *Editor's note: The deisre to post this review was not there. Not
            fun. Mostly a sad and pathetic trip. Putting it up in the spirit of
            honesty though.*
          </p>
          <p>
            Went 2 taco bell. Currently in da parking lot.<br />
            No pre fit check 2 day. Didn‚Äôt take oneüò•
          </p>
          <p>
            Got to the bell. Interior: locked. Tragic. It wasn‚Äôt closing time
            though. According to the schedule they have posted they should‚Äôve
            had the interior open but noü•∫<br />
            So i sat in my car for like 10 minutes.<br />
            Then went through the drive through. Got a single double beef
            grilled cheese burrito.
          </p>
          <p>
            I sat in my car and ate it in like a somg and a half- so probably
            less that 6 or 7 minutes. No baja.
          </p>

          <div class="review">

            <p>
              I don‚Äôt have the same burrito eating or enjoyment endurance

          <p>Not a fan of eating in the car. Too chaotic.</p>
          <p>
            Really a mid Taco Bell experience. Might‚Äôve been better if i had
            taken it home. The first bite though, super hot, super good.

            *Here's some Bencer lore. Feel free to skip if you're just here for
            the funny.*
          </p>
          <div class="bencerlore">
            I‚Äôm here because i was programming- working with something I thought
            i knew well but have learned that my foolish pretense was false. I
            felt that pang of ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt go‚Äù on my way out. I know the other
            side of that coin though. The feeling that comes if I choose not to
            go can often be just as painful unless i have something better to do
            and do it. I‚Äôve tried to figure out what coming to taco bell
            provides for me. Looking at what happens, it‚Äôs an opportunity to
            drive, be away from the mess of my house and desk, a chance to
            write, eat- and most days try something new-, and it gives me
            something I enjoy doing at home to look forward to.<br /><br />

            The costs i‚Äôve considered are the time it takes- opportunity cost,
            the money it takes- a sort of financial opportunity cost, and a but
            of dignity. There are definitely days where the thought of seeing
            the same taco bell workers at taco bell makes me want to not go.
          </div>
          <p>
            Mid eating, went for a refill. I noticed the taco bell propaganda on
            the wall was still advertising the steal a base steal a taco and
            it‚Äôs been like a month since that happened. The deal expired weeks
            ago. Maybe I could ask for it.

              It could cease to exist and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd notice. Feels like a
              default taco bell item. The 5/10 standard. <br />*Editors note:
              I'd like to correct this. Probably more of a 3/10.

              H*ck dawg, this was good. I‚Äôll give the saucy deets here too. I
              got 9 sauces via the handful method. I had 4 when i was ready to
              conquer the beefy 7. I didn‚Äôt think that would be adequate so i
              got 8 more. Used 8 mild sauces for the burrito. It was a
              tremendous battle. I the ratio was like 1 sauce packet for every
              bite and a half. The burrito just kept soaking up the sauce. I
              think the worst bit was the last one where it was mostly tortilla
              and way too much sauce but I don‚Äôt like to seriously consider that
              bite in my score. Taco bud remained unharmed in the eating of the
              beefy 7.

          <p>Back to my taco bell lore:</p>
          <div class="bencerlore">
            I think taco bell provides a sense of getting something done, but
            unfortunately one that can become extremely shallow if done too
            frequently. Trying everything on the menu is fun and I don‚Äôt think
            there‚Äôs anything wrong with it but it‚Äôs a false god and using it as
            a primary source of satisfaction and accomplishment in life is
            setting myself up for disappointment. That‚Äôs why i want to pick
            apart what i like about it and see if I can create an alternative
            copium that costs me less to sub out for taco bell some times.

          <p>
            I went to the one by the temple. Their interior was closed. It
            almost broke me. That little feeling i had- that i was wasting time
            going to taco bell- that i had chosen to push aside, came flooding
            back and I didn‚Äôt feel good. I also knew traffic going back would be
            terrible, and that the other taco bell didn't have the one thing I
            wanted- the 7 layer nacho fries burrito.
          </p>
          <p>Saw a pretty sunset on my way to the other one thoughü•π</p>

          <p>When i pulled up, the place was almost empty.</p>

            I had another moment when I questioned my entire existence because I
            didn‚Äôt know what to order.

          <p>
            Turns out the taco bell on eagle does offer the 7 layer nacho fries

              the first time i‚Äôve had a taco bell item with guacamole and it was

              taco bell trip- on the food side- to victory. Got a little tired
              of it half way through, so i took a break. Sipped some baja, let
              it rest, and it‚Äôs finish was strong üí™ üí™ . The rice, chipotle

            I went to the temple taco bell and the lobby was closed. I could‚Äôve

            uncomfortable.<br />
            I went to the classic taco bell and they didn‚Äôt have the 7 layer

            No fork in the bag either. After embarking upon my odyssey to the
            other side of the lobby, to my utter dismay I discovered there were
            no forks. I had to take on the enchirito with a knife. And I did it.

              sauce already i do indeed think the mild sauce improved it.
              Miraculous. The last bite was distinctly cold. I kinda enjoyed the

          <h3>16 November 2022</h3>
          <p>Here at the one by the temple</p>
          <p>
            Today at work i spent a lot of the day working in excel, doing a
            project i get paid nowhere near enough to do- but i want work to be
            meaningful and i think it will be good for me. It really burned me
            out though. I don‚Äôt think my teenage coworkers and their drama helps
            either. Got home and ate something. That helped take the edge off
            but i felt like doing nothing. I took a shower and considered going
            to taco bell after getting a project done for monolith and that made
            me feel hopeful.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the shower i did not, in fact, get that project done for
            monolith. I sat at my desk thinking about how little i wanted to
            work on anything. It was frustrating to be in a place where i had
            time to work on what I wanted to but no motivation to do it. It all
            felt pointless. I ended up wandered around looking at watch options
            online. Finally bought a new oneü§ó
          </p>
          <p>
            After that i felt better. Major copium right there. That enabled me
            to go to taco bell. I think spending money primes me to spend more.
            In another way i felt like i had accomplished something. A low bar
            but in a way i had gotten something done. I had given enough care
            about the future to buy a watch I thought looked nice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just popped out to the car. The taco bell closed about 20 minutes
            after i showed up and I started to feel unwelcome with them cleaning
            it. Now I‚Äôm watching people try to go to the drive thru and get the
            rude awakening that taco bell is CLOSED. 2 so far.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway. Drove twice as far to go to the one by the temple. I didn‚Äôt
            want to deal with the social aspect of the workers at taco bell I
            usually go to and Ready didn‚Äôt want to feel weird so I didn‚Äôt dress
            up.
          </p>

            alt="me i suppose"
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <p>
            When i pulled up i put in my order and started considering why i was
            there and if I really wanted to eat or if it was a waste. I almost
            walked out and just went home again. But no, i went for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Got the food out quickly. This taco bell feels even more soulless
            then the one I usually go to. The only soul it does have is provided
            by the memories i‚Äôve made here. It was clean though.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grabbing a lid, I noticed something. They‚Äôve been holding back on
            me?? How many quesaritos do i have to order before they let me into
            the back room where they keep the x-large cups?

              The food served its purpose. Nacho fries good. In a moment of
              weakness and thoughtlessness, i dipped my soft taco in cheese
              sauce. Never again. Never again. The beefy 5 had beans on one end,
              beef on the other. Rip. Still good. Baja was good. If you had to
              press me for a score? Overall, (Thrembo/10)

            <p>
              There was one other dude in the restaurant. I think he got the
              same thing i did. (He‚Äôs literally me)

            <p>
              It feels like something‚Äôs wrong if taco bell is what‚Äôs providing
              me hope. I get that we have to interact with material things and
              they serve a purpose in emotion but-

              i think. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what I got tho. Because it had steak
              on it. And I haven‚Äôt finished it yet because the fast food steak
              is nasty. Pretty sure there isn‚Äôt enough mild sauce in the world
              to fix that one.
            </p>
            <p>
              The other thing I got was rice and beans? I don‚Äôt know. I paid two
              dollar for it and that felt like way more than i should‚Äôve paid
              but i did anyway. I didn‚Äôt even give it a chance without the
              sauce. I immediately smothered it and i can say without hesitation
              that there is enough sauce in the world to make the rice and bean
              bowl at taco bell good. It‚Äôs only like 2 sauces actually. Who
              knows it might even be good without it.

              This burrito continues to stare at me. I will now end the
              suffering of both of us.<br />
              Lost some valiant unused sauce packets in my effort to dispose of

              I‚Äôm going to check my email to see if i ordered the wrong thing or
              if they got my order wrong.<br />
              Still haven‚Äôt gotten my receipt. I‚Äômma say they got my order wrong
              and chalk this up as a mulligan. This burrito gets a 1/10. I
              reserve the right to give zeros (and negative) but the first bite
              gave me a glimmer of hope so we go with one.

              I think I only came to taco bell tonight because I didn‚Äôt want to
              sit at my computer and feel guilty about not doing anything. I
              should probably fix that. Instead i get to go home and feel guilty

              experience today. That nacho sauce contained the unmatched power
              of the sun and was almost too hot to bear on the first bite.

            Quick situation update. This is where i was at mentally before i bit
            into this. I was starting to feel full. I saw i had 2 items left-
            the beefy 7 and a chalupa. I wasn‚Äôt sure if i‚Äôd be able to finish
            both so i had to eat the one I actually wanted to eat first. I think
            I made the right choiceü§ù

              My first bite made me pretty sure this is the best thing i‚Äôve ever
              had at taco bell. Grilled cheese burrito vibes. Quesarito vibes.
              Spicy potato taco vibes. A little hint of barbecue chip flavor. It
              was SO good. Unfortunately burritos aren‚Äôt just judged by their
              first bite. This thing is kinda a monster. 3/4 of the way through
              it started to get old (that‚Äôs not exactly it but I don‚Äôt know how
              else to describe it). That feeling took it out contention for the
              10/10 ranking.<br />
              The last few bites were almost as good as the first tho.<br />

              Post game edit: I ran out of sauce on my last bite of the beefy 7
              so the visit felt complete- Had to respect the wisdom of the
              handful method and know when to quit.

              too. As i could be the cause of the Baja blast ‚Äúnot hitting

              Got a good hold for the sauce, but not so great towards the end of

              the sort of springy mozzarella cheese.

              I was scared about the black bean quesarito‚Ä¶ it pains and shames
              me to admit that of it was decent. Of all the things you could use
              to replace meat in a burrito, black beans are not the worst pick.
              Gave me solid quesarito vibes. Was a little cheaper too. Gotta
              hand it to taco bell- they don‚Äôt know how to ruin something by
              making it vegetarian.

              kinda sucks.
            </p>
            <h4>Baja blast I imagined the entire time: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              The light at the end of all my tunnels. The hope that garnished
              every bite of this mid tier beefy melt. The mild sauce to my taco
              bell experience burrito.
            </p>
            <h4>My friend‚Äôs nacho fries: (i heard they were good/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Saw a monstrous clump of them. I‚Äôm sure those were either
              fantastic or not cooked enough and nasty.
            </p>

          <p>
            While eating on a couch, without baja blast or a table- a special
            sauce protocol was developed. Don‚Äôt tear the corner of the sauce
            past the edge, so it doesn‚Äôt get completely torn off, and dead sauce
            packets get placed between the burrito and its wrapping.
          </p>
          <p>This new method lead to a pleasant couch taco bell experience.</p>

            Looking kinda dead inside but that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs not accurate anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            I put a lot of thought into the timing of this visit. I have stuff
            going on Thursday and Friday and maybe Saturday. I wanted to wait
            the bell out so I‚Äôd appreciate it more again but time‚Äôs not on my
            side on that one so here i am.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fixed my car tonight. Almost skipped the suit but i felt grimy after
            the brake job so I showered up and showed the bell the respect it
            deserves.<br />
            Got some 17HMR on the way. Dummy expensiveüòê. More than 9mm. Smh my
            head.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bell was quiet upon arrival. No hooligans terrorizing the land
            of the *bonnnnnnnnng*.<br />
            I tried ordering the steal a base free taco but the app wasn‚Äôt
            having it. Not sure what‚Äôs wrong. I tried ordering it with or
            without anything else in the "cart". No dice
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm impressed with the tray today. Napkins. Sauce. A fork. Meal
            delivery fit for a king. All for like 6 dollery doos. The industrial

              Ok- last time i realized my error. I was going for
              quesarito/grilled cheese burrito vibes without the sauce. It was
              30 cents extra,and so was the rice, but still a steal when in the
              box. My guy delivered this time. I was getting mad quesarito (or
              grilled cheese burrito without the grilled cheese)vibes and I
              enjoyed it tremendously. I miss the grilling the quesarito gets
              though. We‚Äôll see if i can change that. Also could be good with
              nacho fries on it.

              I‚Äôve always kinda liked the ChupSup. Usually they‚Äôre colder than i
              like so i waited to eat it last since I didn‚Äôt think it would make
              a difference. I think i was right but that first bite today came
              out of left field. The chalupa exterior-tortilla thing was more
              soft and supple than usual. Took the chalupa from good to great on
              this visit

            Ok Now for the miracle of the mild sauce.<br />
            I asked for 13 sauces. Got 11. Kinda disappointed that I got the
            handful counting method, but i chose to see how far the handful
            counting method could get me. The last sauce packet delivered me
            PERFECTLY to the last bite of my chalupa supreme. I was a part time

            <p>
              Probably a mistake to get it this trip. It‚Äôs a beefy 5 burrito
              with rice swapped for beans. Hoping to get quesarito vibes but it
              missed. Thought it was pretty good when I was paying attention. I
              think the beans are the weakest part of the beefy 5. Also waited
              forever to eat it so it might be better hotter.

              I got 2 bites in and the interior was so liquid-ous that I tapped

              It slapped too. I was kinda skeptical for a few reason. Not a fan
              of the grease on the grilled cheese burrito and hated the steak on
              the nacho truff fries, but this thing delivered. I used the paper
              to hold it and the grease didn‚Äôt bother me at all. Gave me grilled
              cheese burrito vibes and I really enjoyed it. The chipotle sauce
              is so good.

            I noticed something. I prefer biting the right side of my burritos.
            I just watched myself turn the burito 180 degrees so I could bite
            the right side instead of the left. I think this right side
            preference comes from me primarily holding burritos in my left hand,
            and using the precision of my right hand to apply sauce in proper
            sauce proportions.
          </p>
          <p>Food:</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Beefy melt burrito: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Maybe this comes from being in a low place but this burrito was SO
              GOOD. The rice, the cheese. The other things. Perfection. Even the
              blob of sour cream at the bottom provided an interesting second
              half. This is the first time i‚Äôve noticed a taco bell item have a
              glob of sour cream at only one end. I don‚Äôt give the 10/10
              lightly. I think there was only one bite that didn‚Äôt fill me with
              joy.
            </p>
            <h4>Cheesy bean and rice burrito: (6/10)</h4>
            <p>
              First half was STRAIGHT bean. Second half had some rice and cheese
              too. First half was a 5/10. Second half a 7/10.
            </p>
            <h4>The quesarito: (8/10)</h4>
            <p>
              This thing was bomb. I ordered all these items individually and
              the quesarito is like 4$ but it was worth it. Gave me grilled
              cheese burrito vibes too, particularly on the second half. I think
              the chipotle sauce wasn‚Äôt evenly distributed and it only hit me
              the second half. Another heavy hitting heavenly taco bell item.
            </p>
            <h4>Baja blast: (üòá/10)</h4>
            <p>
              A heavenly experience. The good old baja blast hit the spot.
              Especially when i over filled the cup, then put the lid on and
              some of it spilled down the sides and out the straw hole onto the
              lid and i kinda sucked it up off the top. That was really good.
              The first sip was really good too.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The rice really carried this meal. The true 2nd MVP behind the
            blast. I want to get a beefy 5 with rice instead of beans. I spilled
            baja blast on my suit and tie this trip.

            This is an emotionally charged taco bell visit. Lots of üÖ±Ô∏èencer lore
            too.
          </p>
          <p>
            The brake master cylinder on my 1997 toyota rav4‚Äôs not doing too
            hot. I got the part in and went to replace it with a friend.
            Discovered half way through i had the wrong brake master cylinderüòê
            got the car put back together and felt terrible about not
            accomplishing what I set out to do so I decided to hit the bell.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn‚Äôt really want to eat and wasn‚Äôt even craving the bell but i
            knew i needed to eat and felt like going anyway. Kinda sounds like
            an addiction but‚Ä¶ü§´
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, i pull up to the holy bell. Off cole and overland- by the
            temple. Parking lot is packed. Drive thru is bussin. (Here‚Äôs the pre
            fit check)(clothes I didn‚Äôt care about getting greasy)(car or taco
            bell grease)
          </p>

          <p>
            The taco bell's interior was flowing with taco bell patrons. No idea
            if these people were true taco bell fans either. The seat i usually
            sit at‚Äôs open but someone‚Äôs also sitting a table over. All good, no
            problem. I go to order on the app and decide to go for the app
            exclusive box. That‚Äôs when i see the disclaimer. ‚ÄúThis t bizzy
            location closing in 7 minutes dawg. No app ordering allowed.‚Äù TACO
            BELL CLOSING AT 7????? Literally 1984. I peaced the f*tch out dawg.
            I was DONE with that location and all those wanna be taco bell
            lovers.
          </p>
          <p>
            So i drove down overland. I hit autozone and bought some rain-x

          <p>I ordered the mobile exclusive box. A solid deal.</p>
          <p>
            I went to the bathroom and cleaned up the absolute pile of paper
            towels around the garbage can. Gotta look out for a taco-homieü§ù.
            The paper towel was still in the urial that was there yesterday

            Sauce packets I got - 0 (also mild)<br />

          <p>
            Upon filling my cup i grabbed a lid. I kinda manhandled the lid
            below the one i grabbed too. Gross to think about. Then it dawned on
            me that the two lids I touched weren‚Äôt properly in the stack so
            someone else had probably touched mine.<br />
            Such is the nature of ‚ÄúThe cycle of manhandling lids‚Äù<br />
            I hate the containers the lids at this taco bell are kept in
            tooüôÇ<br />
            I‚Äôm usually pretty good about throwing away lids I touch and don‚Äôt

            <h4>Spicy potato taco: (9/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I‚Äôve had this before and didn‚Äôt remember really liking it, but the
              first bite was heaven. Actually the first half was heaven. It gave
              me barbecue chip vibes and i love me some barbecue chips. The hot
              chip is to the latina girl as the barbecue chip is to the white
              boy. Potatoes were a nice texture too. The spice was right on the
              edge between good and annoying. Probably the biggest upset in taco
              bell reviews seen this taco bell season.
            </p>
            <h4>Fiesta potatoes: (6/10)</h4>
            <p>
              (what i needed the fork for)<br />
              The potatoes today were alright. I applied the taco bell doctrine
              learned last time and put 4 sauces on before mixing. It didn‚Äôt all
              mix together correctly but I can‚Äôt complain about getting a packed
              fiesta potatoes containerüòè Potatoes were a bit soft. Added
              another sauce by the end and enjoyed the last few bites a lot.
            </p>
            <h4>Crunchwrap supreme: (8/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Another upset tonight. It‚Äôs truly been quite the taco bell
              experience. I‚Äôm glad i gave the crunchwrap another try because i
              was pleasantly surprised. It was consistently warm. The hardshell
              tostada inside provided me the taste of a hardshell taco without
              the mess and the ingredients delivered a classic taco bell taste.
              Cannot complain. On the last bite i ran out of sauce. So i went
              and grabbed another packet.
            </p>
            <h4>Baja blast: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>Tastes (tasted) really good</p>
            <h4>Baja blast shivers: (0/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I‚Äôm COLD DAWG. I went out to the car and grabbed another jacket
              and I‚Äôm STILL cold. Not even the shivers can stop me from the
              cool, refreshing, invigorating, dream defying, car fixing, and
              revelatory experience of baja blastüòé

            When i was almost finished writing my reviews, the taco bell worker
            called my name. (Spencer, not bencer) It seems there‚Äôs another
            customer named Spencer. He looks like soap from modern warfare.<br />

            The shivers are real. I‚Äôm fr really cold rn.<br />

            Made some art today too.

          <p>
            Today‚Äôs pregame was well thought out. I made a meme earlier and it
            inspired me.

            I came straight from FHE so i had to make some serious strategic

            Inside the bell was cozy. Warm shelter from the drip(my fit)
            outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only was it temporally comforting, but it felt traditional too.
            Empty. Kinda sorta clean. The one worker on break sipping
            gatorade(another great mystery of taco bell‚Äôs drink selection) and
            facetiming someone in spanish way too loud. Home sweet home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dolly parton‚Äôs mexican pizza musical advertisement meme inspired me
            to order the mexican pizza today. I remember getting it once on the
            mission, and also remember the astounding disappointment I
            experienced at the time. Needless to say the bar was low.
          </p>
          <p>
            When my food was ready, the worker hesitantly called out ‚Äúbencer‚Äù. A
            name that requires CONFIDENCE to be articulated correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had to ask for a cup. I was hopeful the sauce was already in there
            but I should‚Äôve known that having to ask for the cup was a bad sign
            because they used the worst, but perhaps most common sauce counting
            method. The SIUaDIY sauce counting method. (Suck It Up and Do It
            Yourself). It‚Äôs oküòû i‚Äôm used to it. I decided to counter with the
            double handful counting method to stick it to em.

            Here‚Äôs me, and the food. I‚Äôll probably never wear these glasses
            again i feel like i look like a bozo.

          <p>FINALLY- onto the review</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Mexican pizza: (5/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I feel that all enjoyment came from the low bar. It‚Äôs Like a hard
              shell taco with tons of ground beef and cooked extra long.
              Probably about as good as a hard shell taco. Maybe a smidge
              better. A common thread throughout the food i try, but the mild
              sauce carried it.
            </p>
            <h4>The nacho fries: (7/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Not feeling them as much today. Still good though. I ended up
              mixing 4 sauces into the cheese sauce since the cheese was dummy
              thicc. My experience with the cheese sauce taught me some true
              taco bell doctrine. The sauce doctrine- never too much taco bell
              sauce Which called back and reinforced another taco bell truth:
              ‚ÄúTrue [taco bell] doctrine, understood, changes [taco bell orders]
              faster than a study of [taco bell orders] changes [taco bell

              I figured the review would be more interesting if I switched it
              up.<br />
              The supreme DLT wasn‚Äôt all crumbled like the last time. Already a
              win. The sour cream on it was good. I definitely enjoyed it more
              that the regular DLT but I don‚Äôt know if It was worth the premium.
              Maybe I could just bring my own sour cream next time.

          <p>
            At this point in my taco bell adventure, i took a moment to breathe
            and relax and enjoy the taco bell atmosphere. The lobby was still
            empty at this point in the journey. The warmth of the bell really
            helps to counter the gallons of ice cold baja blast i down.

              I don‚Äôt know chief. I really didn‚Äôt want to back down from the t
              bizzy challenge. I was feeling really full though. My bull headed
              taco bell nature pushed me though. I took a few bites and‚Ä¶ gave
              up. It wasn‚Äôt stellar either. Probably like a 2/10 if i did give
              it a rating. I kept trying to eat it as i wrote this review but it
              got kinda crusty and only tasted like refried beans. Not even
              sauce could save this one boss. Tragic.

            One of the great mysteries of taco bell is this: how can I pull up
            to a taco bell that has no cars in the drive thru and nobody waiting

            Got the nacho fries box. Swapped the hardshell for a soft. Late
            night snack of champions:

          <div class="review">
            <h4>Nacho fries: (9/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Ok this time I mixed the mild sauce in with cheese sauce and it
              was what‚Äôs up. Truly thinking outside the bun here. It‚Äôs in my
              DNA. The thinner sauce really complimented the fries and bumped up
              the score.
            </p>
            <h4>Soft taco: (7/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Pretty good. Nothing special. The mild sauce really carried it
              though. Seems to be a trend around here. Better than a hardshell
              taco but not peak taco bell

              This beefy 5 did the job. Mopped up the last of the mild sauce
              cheese sauce. Really carried this taco bell experience in terms of
              satiation. Still haven‚Äôt figured out if the beefy 5 or this taco

            The bell was tolling for me all day at work. I got home, took care
            of boxes and put on the tbizzy fit.<br />
            ‚ÄúHello my name is Spencer. I‚Äôm a recovering taco bell addict. It‚Äôs
            been 4 days since i‚Äôve rung the bell‚Äù Well. Now it‚Äôs 0 haha

          <p>
            Before coming to the bell I remembered some other stuff I needed to
            take care of. Decided to just hit the bell and deal with it later.

            The bell was suspiciously clean today. No sauce artwork on the
            tables or lettuce landmines on the floor. My order was pretty quick.
            Nice üëç. I saw a real miracle too. There were some individuals here

            No wonder they‚Äôre reasonably priced stillüòûüòûüòû- there‚Äôs like 11
            real ones and a few fragments. Sadness aside, this cost less than my
            last trip where i only paid for a quesarito and truff nacho fries.
            Solid valueüí∏
          </p>
          <p>
            I requested 12 sauces and they gave me 11. Close enough. Feeling
            proud of my taco bell workersü´°ü´°ü´°
          </p>
          <p>Here‚Äôs the juicy deets on the eats:</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Nacho fries:(8/10)</h4>
            <p>
              The 13 fries i got were pretty good. (Didn‚Äôt actually count) I ate
              them first since I figured they‚Äôd get cold fast. Despite eating
              them immediately they weren‚Äôt mouth burning and I appreciate that.
              Solid flavor, good with sauce and queso dip. Glad they back. Not
              sure if they‚Äôre better than the grilled cheese burrito. It was
              ripped from my grilled cheese greasy hands before i could truly
              make up my mind.
            </p>
            <h4>Doritos locos taco: (5/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Probably a downside of the stuffed box but it took the pleasure of
              falling apart before i got to it and it wasn‚Äôt as good as usual.
              Roll of the dice and shake of the taco I guess. We all fall apart
              sometimes and i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be better next time.
            </p>
            <h4>Chalupa supreme- steak: (3/10)</h4>
            <p>
              I think this is my first time having a steak chalupa supreme but i
              did not enjoy it. The steak reminded me of really cheap elementary
              school meals and the tomatoes were a little bitter. Perhaps the
              first time I didn‚Äôt really want to finish an item at taco bell.
            </p>
            <h4>Beefy 5: (6/10)</h4>
            <p>
              My hopes were riding high when I started on this boy. The fries
              were good but i had just taken 2 L‚Äôs with the taco and chalupa.
              The beefy 5 didn‚Äôt deliver though. The expectations: too high. The
              weight: too much. The burrito folded. It was just ok. Not
              fantastic, not terrible, and certainly not enough to make up for
              the 2 blunders before it. I‚Äôm sorry beefy 5. The mild sauce on it
              took it from a 5 to a 6 tho.
            </p>
            <h4>Baja blast: (10/10)</h4>

            Another redeeming element of this visit was something i heard when I
            started writing this review:

            *dude walks in- with his wife- and approaches the counter*<br />
            ‚ÄúYou guys start making the encharitos yet?‚Äù<br />

          </p>

          <p>
            Eh. The trip to taco bell was a solid value but disappointing. Kinda
            don‚Äôt want to get the deluxe nacho fries cravings box again. Or swap
            out the steak for chicken or beef on the chalupa if I do. That was
            painful üòñ<br />
            I went through 6 mild sauce packets. I couldn‚Äôt sworn i used more.
            Maybe my experience could‚Äôve been better if i had used all 11.

            Today was a 20 mile trip to taco bell and a quick stop to take a few
            shots with my brave weapon: ‚Äúdel taco exterminus XII‚Äù Gotta keep the
            skills sharp to reclaim the holy land and cleanse the earth of del
            taco infidels.
          </p>
          <p>Deus voltage</p>
          <p>
            Anyway. I pulled up to t bizzy- as one does- and gotta kinda scared
            when i saw the drive thru empty. My fears of a closed taco bell were
            unfounded though. I walk in to an empty taco bell. Perfect.<br />
          </p>
          <p>The hot sauce packets all over the ground: picturesque.</p>
          <p>
            The rice, lechuga, cheese and sauce remnants on the table: a
            masterpiece.
          </p>
          <p>
            The garbage can of the bathroom i washed my hands in: covered in
            paper towels.
          </p>
          <p>The paper towel dispenser: paper towel-less</p>
          <p>My hands: very wet.</p>
          <p>Yes. The true taco bell experience is to be had here.<br /></p>
          <p>
            I sit down and look through my helmet to look at my phone‚Ä¶ until a
            family walk in. Then like 2 more families walk in.üòê The one day i
            wear something nice to taco bell is the day the lobby is PACKED. And
            the kids aren‚Äôt good at not staring or talking about people in same
            room quietly yet. I finally got my order and I was kinda done
            listening to the 15 other people here so i put in my earbuds.
            Mindecraft music go hard.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems they may have figured out that i just eat my order in the
            lobby and didn‚Äôt fill my drink this time.(could also be wrong about
            that because there‚Äôs been a baja blast sitting on the mobile pickup
            shelf almost the entire time i‚Äôve been here)
          </p>
          <p>I went to fill my drink and‚Ä¶ tragedy struck.</p>

          <p>
            I was going to get another grilled cheese burrito but true tragedy
            struck. It seems in getting nacho fries back, i lost the opportunity
            to try the grilled cheese burrito again. Sadness.

          <p>My order:</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Quesarito: (7/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Pretty solid. A hefty price tho. The first bite was cloud 9. It
              felt like what I imagine taco bell is when i‚Äôm craving it. The
              rest of the burrito was ok. Kinda seemed like a grilled cheese
              burrito without the grilled cheese or purple fritos.
            </p>
            <h4>Loaded truff nacho fries: (3/10)</h4>
            <p>
              The truff hot sauce isn‚Äôt anything special. I took one bite before
              absolutely smothering it in mild sauce. It was bearable after that
              but i‚Äôm not getting it again. Also kinda expensive for like 12
              fries with some cheese, 2 tiny strips of steak, sour cream and mid
              tier hot sauce. Never getting them again.

            <h4>Baja blast: (8/10)</h4>
            <p>
              that score is a lie. Just trying to keep you on your toes and see
              if you‚Äôre paying attention. Baja blast is the one true drink. The
              cause for which we war against the del taco infidels. Our
              connection to life and beauty and all her blessings. Without baja
              life wouldn‚Äôt be worth living. Baja blast wills it. Long live the
              baja.
            </p>
            <h4>Minecraft music at the bell: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Besides the blast, it‚Äôs the only redeeming factor of coming to
              taco bell dressed like‚Ä¶ well dressed the way I am.

            Ok ok i know i was here monday, but it‚Äôs for a good cause.

          <p>
            I make my presence know at the t bizzy. Panic sets in when i realize
            some dood‚Äôs sitting where I usually do. Doesn‚Äôt he know who i am?
            Anyway, turns out this guy was a home boy. He was chowing down on a
            box, and before he left I asked him for the cardboard box that taco
            bell boxes come in and he gave it to me. Certified taco bell fiend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Order kinda taking forever. Makes me sad to sit in this taco bell

          <p>Here‚Äôs the lowdown on the food:</p>
          <div class="review">
            <h4>Fiesta potatoes:(whatever I gave them last time+2/10)</h4>
            <p>
              My friend taught me the method. Pouring sauce over them,
              re-lidding and shaking. Pretty good. I enjoyed the evenly
              distributed sour cream cheesey mild sauce over hot crispy potatoes
              a lotü§å Also added more sauce half way through.

              loading="lazy"
            />
            <h4>The bean burrito: (5/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Feels like the perfect score for this item. Default loadout taco
              bell. The taco bell elder. To be respected, but it‚Äôs
              evolutions/offspring are so much better. It really delivered on
              its promise though. Every bite was just like the one before and
              after it. Tortilla with a hint of refried beans and the distant
              thought of cheese. Out of left field came the onion though. I
              didn‚Äôt even know taco bell had onions??? Felt a little foreign in
              this burrito but added a nice bit of variety in flavor among a sea
              of B E A N.
            </p>
            <h4>Cheesy Gordita Crunch: (7/10)</h4>
            <p>
              The debate (among my fellow taco bell lovers) on the gordita
              crunch hasn‚Äôt been as heated as the grilled cheese burrito, but
              there seem to be strong feelings tied to it. Having never tried it
              myself I had a bit of skepticism. I unwrapped the crunch and i
              thought it was a joke. A cruel joke where someone just put a dummy
              thicc tortilla around a crunchy taco. Pretty sure that‚Äôs exactly
              what it is, but my experience was far better than a hard shell
              taco. The fat Tortilla really adds to the experience. It plays the
              same roll as the doritos advertising cardboard that comes with the
              doritos locos taco, holding the super crunchy tortilla together,
              but edible so it‚Äôs worlds better. I suspect the tortilla also
              helps keep the delicate taco warm longer. I ate this item last.
              Next time i get it i‚Äôll eat it first (so it‚Äôs warmer) and I
              suspect it will be even better.
            </p>
            <h4>Finally, baja blast: (10/10)</h4>
            <p>
              My light in the wilderness. The perfect wingman, conversation
              starter AND palate cleanser. The MP5 of sodas. Smooth and
              reliable. The apex of taco bell/ mountain dew engineering.
              Timeless, and loved the world over. Just makes the whole
              experience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            As i ate my bean burrito I thought about the experience of dressing
            up to visit taco bell. If I‚Äôm keeping it real- I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôd do
            it if someone else I knew was doing it too. Also might quit if
            someone tried to copy me. My theory is that the fun of being
            acoustic and dressing up for taco bell would be ruined if it seemed
            less acoustic (i.e. someone more normal than me doing it). That
            thought‚Äôs half baked though. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to ever copy me
            either.
          </p>

            Head-on-light-fixture-contact count this time(so far): 0 I‚Äôm pleased
            to announce i will no longer be mentioning the light unless I hit it
            with my head again.

            Ok pre game check. I thought i might hit the bell after FHE. Was
            already wearing nice pants so I brought my suit jacket. Perhaps gray
            on gray is a fashon crime. So what if i‚Äôm a criminal.

            I pull up to t bizzy. They‚Äôre the fastest burrito makers in the
            west. (It took like 2 minutes from ordering) so i held off from
            ordering until being greeted by the overwhelming experience of the
            bell‚Äôs interior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entering the t bell, i saw all the regular sights, sounds and
            wonders. (Worker on break, soda drips all over the fountain machine,
            general mexican smell) but also took in the beauty of a taco bell
            ready for halloween. They basically have decorations everywhere and
            it really improves on the true mexican and day of the dead feel i‚Äôve
            come to expect.

              Honestly don‚Äôt think i can give the grilled cheese burrito a fair
              shake on this visit, despite coming exclusively to review it (and
              enjoy 4 gallons of baja blast). Just not feeling fantastic tonight
              so i‚Äôll hold off on the official bell review‚Ñ¢ score. Despite being
              made lightning fast and cracking into the burrito almost
              immediately, if wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbeefy 5 straight off the line‚Äù hot which I

              flex but no. It‚Äôs buying standalone items off the menu instead of
              getting them in a box. The burrito was decent. I think the worst
              part is the grease. I don‚Äôt think burritos from t bizzy should
              glisten(see below). They already shine bright enough on their
              own‚ú®(Without the oil from the cheese being pressed into them by a
              wrapping)

              If i ever go into a coma just tell the doctors to put this in my
              IV and it‚Äôll bring me back. They should reverse engineer this
              stuff and maybe they‚Äôd fix cancer.

            During my visit, a worker was cleaning the tables and a manager or
            someone like that came out and told them to clean the window and
            wall behind a bench. The smell of the chemicals and talk of grease
            cleaning really complimented the god-tier elixir (baja blast) and
            the [deferred judgment] grilled cheese burrito. This has really made
            my taco bell experience. A true cherry on top.

            This would be the end of my email but I‚Äôm waiting to see if the dood
            who just ordered and sat down is going to stay and eat or leave once
            he gets his food. Truly fascinating to observe the average taco bell
            enjoyer in the wild.

            Ah. A true taco bell fiend. He is enjoying his t bizzy alone in the
            restaurant. No shame. Just taco bell love. The taco bell experience
            of champions. He failed to get a drink and by extension, baja blast.
            Looks like he got a solid order otherwise. Review of my new taco
            bell enjoying friend: (9/10)

            I pulled up and the drive thru was packed. The t bizzy was looking t
            busy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also lots of cars in the parking lot so i was scared there would
            actually be people besides the one worker always on break in the
            fine dining area.<br />
            Felt like a lady in the drive thru was looking at me and judging me
            but if she was, her judgment means nothing because we‚Äôre both at
            taco bell.
          </p>
          <p>I go in, there were some people but a manageable amount.</p>
          <p>
            They forgot my drink so i snagged that boy. Filled it with the great
            blessings of heaven (baha blast)(my cup overfloweth) and took a
            seat.
          </p>

            My last visit, they had carefully and lovingly placed the requested
            number of sauce packets of each variety in the box. This visit, upon
            opening the bag I discovered they used the handful method to count
            the sauces. Some might argue it‚Äôs the superior method but I withhold
            judgment.

            <h4>the chipotle ranch grilled chicken burrito:(4/10)</h4>
            <p>
              decent price but not that great. Not a fan of a lukewarm burrito.
              A little spicy- but not the ‚Äútastes good, glad it‚Äôs there‚Äù spicy
              and more just annoying spicy.
            </p>
            <h4>the go-to beefy 5:(this visit)(6/10)</h4>
            <p>
              decent I guess. Could‚Äôve been warmer. kinda just made me want more
              (but better) taco bell(maybe the point?) not as good as the beefy
              5 i had earlier this week.
            </p>
            <h4>the baha blast:(Too good for my rank scheme/10)</h4>
            <p>
              Last but certainly not least- actually the best part. Got a large
              this time. It‚Äôs the same drink you get in the medium, and i‚Äôm
              still chilling in the lobby and will probably drink just as much
              either way, but there‚Äôs something special about the large- like
              the pride of paying 30 cents more for essentially the same thing.
              It makes it even more magical. When money‚Äôs tight, you gotta flex
              on the poors somehow.

            Hit my head 0 times (so far) on this visit.<br /><br /><br />
            (post t bizzy update)<br />
            As i was cleaning up I decided I wanted to take the sauce packets. I
            felt guilty for a moment until I realized they gave me that many and
            the sin was on the heads of the taco bell workers.<br />
            Got out to my car. Spilled glorious baja blast on my seat and suit.
            Tragic loss of baja blast. May those 4 fluid ounces rest in peace
            (in my 1997 rav 4 upholstery)
